  ## Installation
  
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  
  ## Usage
  
  After installation, use the application by running `node index.js` in your terminal. You'll be prompted with a series of questions about your project. Answer each question with appropriate information, and upon completion, a professional `README.md` file will be generated in the project directory. You can then copy this file to your own project or modify it as needed.
